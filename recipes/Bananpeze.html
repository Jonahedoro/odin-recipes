   <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
   <p>Banan, or I should say plantains, are quite common in the Caribbean.Peze means press. So essentially, banan peze is "pressed plantains". If fried the right way, they can be a delicious, crisp appetizer. </p>
   <p>This is also a common dish in Haiti.</p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Plantain(s)</li>
    <li>2 cups Vegetable Oil </li>
    <li>2 tsps. Lime OR Lemon Juice </li>
    <li>¾ tsp Salt</li>
    <li>½ cup Water</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Get your oil prepared and heated, the oil must be high enough to fully submerge the plantains while frying.</li>
    <li>Cut the ends and peel the plantains.</li>
    <li>After peeling the plantains, cut them diagonally making about 5 - 6 pieces per plantain.</li>
    <li>Once the oil has reached temperature at medium heat, add in a few of the plantain pieces being sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 4 - 6 minutes.</li>
    <li> While the plantains fry, prepare the salt water solution. In a bowl, add 1/2 cup of water, 3/4 tsp. salt, and 2 tsp. lime or lemon juice.</li>
    <li> After plantains have fried, remove them from the oil and place on a paper towel lined plate. Using a plantain presser, or the smooth underside of a bowl, flatten each piece of plantain.</li>
    <li> The plantains will be fried a second time. However, the temperature of the oil must be increased to HIGH heat. Dip each individual piece of plantain into the salt water mixture for about a second or two and place directly into the hot oil. </li>
    <li>Once fried, remove from hot oil and place on paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess oil.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately</li>
   </ol>
